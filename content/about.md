I'm a full stack developer, an IT operations person, a teacher, and a business owner.

## More about me

I have over 30 years of experience in building businesses, systems, and teams. My strength is in developing high-performing service delivery centers. I have done this several times by building happy and cohesive teams, implementing mature processes, establishing a culture with a deep sense of urgency and ownership, and providing great customer experiences. My experience comes with a deep understanding of the nuances of end-to-end systems implementation. I have implemented several successful projects ground up. My experience in process management is backed by industry frameworks like CMMI and ISO20000. I have managed teams of up to 400 headcount and grown revenue up to $35m. My advocacy is to get Computational Thinking implemented in the Philippine K-12 curriculum.
